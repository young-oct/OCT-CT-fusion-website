        Core functions of ME-OCT
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">One technology, endless diagnostic possibilities</h2>
    <p class="paragraph" id="fisrtWord">
      One of the key benefits of ME-OCT is its ability to produce high-resolution structural imaging of the middle ear space at the point of care without disrupting the tympanic membrane (TM) and exposing patients to radiation. 
      Because of that, 
      ME-OCT has been applied to various clinical applications in otology such as detecting cholesteatomas, 
      assisting in ear surgery, measuring TM thickness, 
      and evaluating otitis media.

      Structural imaging
    </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Morphological diagnostic</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Recently, our lab has expanded the capabilities of ME-OCT beyond its qualitative use in assessing the presence and relative positions of middle ear structures. 
      We have demonstrated that ME-OCT can also serve as a quantitative tool, 
      providing high geometric fidelity images of the middle ear space. 
      This opens up a myriad of diagnostic opportunities for clinicians from many metrology-based applications such as prosthesis sizing, 
      monitoring anatomical changes in healing or in progressive disease, 
      assessing congenital malformations of the middle ear, 
      measurement of TM perforations and quantifying the degree of prosthesis migration. 
      Furthermore, 
      in clinical settings, 
      there is a significant need for real-time visualisation of the middle ear space to observe and capture diagnostically important dynamic changes.
      Addressing this, our lab developed a novel spiral scanning pattern that leverages the fast sweep rate of the akinetic laser in our ME-OCT system. 
      Employing this spiral scanning approach allows for a real-time, 
      distortion-free 4D imaging (three-dimensional imaging over time) of the middle ear space, 
      covering a  \( 10.9 \, \text{mm} \times 30^\circ \times 30^\circ \) field of view (FOV). 
      This continuous imaging can capture dynamic middle ear processes such as muscle contractions, 
      conformational changes due to pressurisation, and the insertion of surgical instruments, 
      enhancing clinical understanding and diagnostic accuracy of middle ear conditions.

      Doppler vibrometry

    <h2 class="subtitle">Vibrometric response of the ossicles to sound</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In addition to structural imaging, 
      OCT can also evaluate middle ear status by detecting micro-movements of the TM, 
      ossicles, and foreign objects (e.g., prostheses or retained surgical items) when present, 
      in response to pure tone sound stimuli with Doppler vibrometry. 
      In particular, 
      OCT-DV can distinguish otosclerotic ears from normal ears in vivo through an intact TM, 
      achieving 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity respectively, 
      based on measurements obtained at the lenticular process of the incus with a 500 Hz stimulation frequency.

    <p class="paragraph">
      During ME-OCT measurements, 
      an acoustic stimulus with a much lower frequency than the laser sweep is generated, 
      causing periodic motion of the structure of interest and introducing a Doppler shift in the measurements.
      This Doppler shift appears as an optical phase shift, 
      modulated at the acoustic stimulus's frequency, 
      between A-lines acquired sequentially in time as illustrated above. 
      The resulting optical phase shift represents a frequency-resolved vibration signature that can be extracted by first calculating the phase difference of sequential A-lines and then taking the Fourier transform (FT) across those phase differences at each depth.
       This approach allows for obtaining velocity information directly with high accuracy and avoids motion noise during acquisition.

      Variance imaging
    </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Motion as contrast agent</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      OCT angiography (OCTA) is another key functional extension of optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
      It is predominantly used in imaging the retinal vasculature, 
      especially in diagnosing conditions like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. 
      OCTA operates by capturing a sequence of time-series images and applying speckle variance analysis to these images to obtain contrasts on motion caused vasculature activities. 
      The blood vessels contain moving erythrocytes that exhibit more rapid changes in OCT speckle patterns compared to surrounding tissues which allows for high-contrast visualisation of vessels against background tissues.      
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In the context of middle ear pathologies, 
      it is of clinical interests in visualising vascularization states. 
      Many common middle ear conditions, 
      such as chronic otitis media and ossicular necrosis, 
      are linked to either mucosal inflammation or inadequate vascularization. 
      Thus, 
      assessing the vascularization of the mucosa could provide valuable diagnostic information. 
      Currently, 
      such assessments predominantly rely on qualitative methods, 
      involving visual inspections of the colour of tympanic membrane (TM) through techniques like otoscopy or microscopic examination. 
      Those conventional approaches, 
      however, 
      are limited in their ability to provide detailed or quantitative assessment of the tympanic membrane (TM) vascularization state. 
      Such insight can be helpful in evaluating the potential success of TM grafts in surgeries like myringoplasty and tympanoplasty given the fact that adequate blood flow is a key factor in ensuring the integration and healing of grafts.

      In this en-face image of the middle ear shown here, 
      structural OCT is overlaid with angiography to provide a detailed view of vascular structures. 
      In particular, 
      the vascularization of the malleus, 
      incus, 
      stapedius, 
      and annulus can be observed, 
      along with areas of high blood flow on the mucosal lining of the promontory. 
      This imagery not only aids in diagnosis but also could provide clinical evidence in formulating effective treatment strategies for various ear pathologies.
